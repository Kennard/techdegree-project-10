#Full Stack App with React and a REST API

Project Overview

This project creates a client for an existing school database REST API.   
The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, this project requires a users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. 

This project used the Create React App tool to set up the initial project. Below is a list of the tools/methods used to build the project:

Use JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for the application in a modular fashion.
Use React Router to set up routes.
Use the Fetch API to fetch data from your REST API.
Allow users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.
